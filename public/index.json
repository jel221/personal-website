It\u0026rsquo;s certainly a lot more interesting than 4A. The labs are very enjoyable, allowing you to gain experience with a variety of analytical tools and equipment. Also, Professors Bediako and Arnold are phenomenal. Some of the best professors I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. It\u0026rsquo;s a required course, but I recommend really understanding and appreciating the content being taught. I also recommend choosing your partners carefully for the final project. I docked half a point because of how unpleasant my experience was in the project.\nWeekly time commitment: 13h (Lecture: 3h, Lab: 4h, Homework: 6h)\nRating: 9.5/10\nCS 61B Data Structures course, with a hint of algorithms. Not to mention the variety of data structures that I learned about, simply interacting with the assignments actually helped me learn a variety of tools, such as Git, testing, and development environments. The course requires you to be a lot more independent, and I truly felt that I was becoming a more competent programmer. The homework and labs are a great supplement to lecture content. Projects are quite time-consuming, but they are very fun and instructive. I learned a lot from this course.\nWeekly time commitment: 8h (Lecture: 3h, Homework: 5h)\nRating: 10/10\nCS 70 Discrete Math. The course content is somewhat interesting, but assignments and exams are a grueling experience. I think there\u0026rsquo;s enough opinions on the Internet about this course, so I won\u0026rsquo;t go further in-depth with this one.\nWeekly time commitment: 8h (Lecture + Discussion: 5h, Homework: 3h)\nRating: 6/10\nHistart 11 Western art history. I was looking for a relatively laid-back breadth course, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how difficult this course was. Nevertheless, what I learned from this course opened my eyes to a whole new world of art, providing me with insight to understand art on a more profound level. It took me a long time to write the essays, since the artworks being analyzed are not covered in lecture; it is up to the student to identify the style and interpret its meaning. There is a lot of content covered, so the exams are also pretty stressful. Still, the usefulness of the content overall outweighs the difficulty of the course.\nWeekly time commitment: 6h (Lecture + Discussion: 4h, Homework: 2h)\nRating: 8/10\n","permalink":"https://ocf.berkeley.edu/~jlaurenceleigh/blog/sp22coursereview/","summary":"Courses taken: Chem 4B, CS 61B, CS 70, Histart 11\nChem 4B Second course in the Chem 4 series.

It attempts to build a solid foundation of general chemistry and lab techniques that are often glossed over and simply accepted as true. For example, it debunks the Bohr model and teaches students the quantum theory of the atom. Furthermore, it familiarizes students with writing formal lab reports and working collaboratively in a lab setting. However, to be blunt, it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly interesting or . Also the first midterm turned out to be reused from a previous semester, which actually didn\u0026rsquo;t match the course content taught in the current curriculum. Not the most organized course, but it has to be taken since it\u0026rsquo;s a requirement.\nWeekly time commitment: 12h (Lecture: 3h, Lab: 4h, Homework: 5h)\nRating: 6/10\nCS 61A First CS course I\u0026rsquo;ve ever taken. Interesting course content and helpful course staff. I would recommend this course to someone looking for challenges that demand creative problem-solving skills. Having had no programming experience, this course was difficult at the beginning; if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an introductory programming course, CS 10 may be more suitable. Even my friends who had significant prior coding experience say that they struggled quite a bit. Nevertheless, it set me up with basic programming knowledge, which helped me create this website.\nWeekly time commitment: 8h (Lecture: 3h, Discussion + Lab: 2h, Homework: 3h)\nRating: 8.5/10\nMath H54 Honors linear algebra. The most eye-opening course I\u0026rsquo;ve taken so far. I strongly recommend taking this course over the regular equivalent course, if you\u0026rsquo;re not looking for menial computational exercises and trivial proofs. The homework is difficult, but it allows you to achieve a deeper understanding of the knowledge. Also I strongly recommend Professor Fan. He is a fantastic lecturer and is very helpful during office hours.\nWeekly time commitment: 10h (Lecture: 3h, Discussion: 2h, Homework: 5h)\nRating: 10/10\nMusic 26AC Explores musical genres from diverse groups in the U.S. Content is very engaging and assignments are generally stress-free. Strongly recommend if you have a basic knowledge of music theory and are interested in exploring various genres of music.\nWeekly time commitment: 5h (Lecture + Discussion: 2h, Homework: 3h)\nRating: 8/10\n","permalink":"https://ocf.berkeley.edu/~jlaurenceleigh/blog/fa21coursereview/","summary":"Courses taken: Chem 4A, CS 61A, Math H54, Music 26AC\nChem 4A General chemistry for College of Chemistry students.
