      <description>Last Christmas by Wham! is truly an iconic Christmas song. It also happens to be one of my favorite songs of all time. I love hearing it everywhere whenever Christmas season comes around.
However, Last Christmas is such a great song that it should be played even outside of Christmas season.
First, Last Christmas is NOT just Christmas music, contrary to popular belief. You can replace every occurence of the word &amp;ldquo;Christmas&amp;rdquo; in the lyrics, and it would still make sense.</description>

      <title>Spring 2022 Course Review</title>

      <description>Courses taken: Chem 4B, CS 61B, CS 70, Histart 11
Chem 4B Second course in the Chem 4 series. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a lot more interesting than 4A. The labs are very enjoyable, allowing you to gain experience with a variety of analytical tools and equipment. Also, Professors Bediako and Arnold are phenomenal. Some of the best professors I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. It&amp;rsquo;s a required course, but I recommend really understanding and appreciating the content being taught.</description>

      <title>Fall 2021 Course Review</title>
      <link>https://ocf.berkeley.edu/~jlaurenceleigh/blog/fa21coursereview/</link>

      <description>Courses taken: Chem 4A, CS 61A, Math H54, Music 26AC
Chem 4A General chemistry for College of Chemistry students. It attempts to build a solid foundation of general chemistry and lab techniques that are often glossed over and simply accepted as true. For example, it debunks the Bohr model and teaches students the quantum theory of the atom. Furthermore, it familiarizes students with writing formal lab reports and working collaboratively in a lab setting.</description>
