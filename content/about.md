I am a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

I'm still exploring possibilities for my career path in CS, so I just code in my free time! Some of my projects include web development, algorithm design, and game development.

Many of my projects are private on GitHub due to personal reasons. If you want to see them, please [contact]({{< ref "/contact" >}} "Contact me") me!

I like to explore nature in my free time. Check out my blog to see some of my adventures!
