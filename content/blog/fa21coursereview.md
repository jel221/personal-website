Courses taken: Chem 4A, CS 61A, Math H54, Music 26AC

## Chem 4A

General chemistry for College of Chemistry students. It attempts to build a solid foundation of general chemistry and lab techniques that are often glossed over and simply accepted as true. For example, it debunks the Bohr model and teaches students the quantum theory of the atom. Furthermore, it familiarizes students with writing formal lab reports and working collaboratively in a lab setting. However, to be blunt, it's not particularly interesting or . Also the first midterm turned out to be reused from a previous semester, which actually didn't match the course content taught in the current curriculum. Not the most organized course, but it has to be taken since it's a requirement.

**Weekly time commitment**: 12h (Lecture: 3h, Lab: 4h, Homework: 5h)

**Rating**: 6/10


## CS 61A

First CS course I've ever taken. Interesting course content and helpful course staff. I would recommend this course to someone looking for challenges that demand creative problem-solving skills. Having had no programming experience, this course was difficult at the beginning; if you're looking for an introductory programming course, CS 10 may be more suitable. Even my friends who had significant prior coding experience say that they struggled quite a bit. Nevertheless, it set me up with basic programming knowledge, which helped me create this website.

**Weekly time commitment**: 8h (Lecture: 3h, Discussion + Lab: 2h, Homework: 3h)

**Rating**: 8.5/10

## Math H54

Honors linear algebra. The most eye-opening course I've taken so far. I strongly recommend taking this course over the regular equivalent course, if you're not looking for menial computational exercises and trivial proofs. The homework is difficult, but it allows you to achieve a deeper understanding of the knowledge. Also I strongly recommend Professor Fan. He is a fantastic lecturer and is very helpful during office hours.

**Weekly time commitment**: 10h (Lecture: 3h, Discussion: 2h, Homework: 5h)

**Rating**: 10/10

## Music 26AC

Explores musical genres from diverse groups in the U.S. Content is very engaging and assignments are generally stress-free. Strongly recommend if you have a basic knowledge of music theory and are interested in exploring various genres of music.

**Weekly time commitment**: 5h (Lecture + Discussion: 2h, Homework: 3h)

**Rating**: 8/10
