This picture is taken from the top of Bald Peak. A beautiful landscape.

Tilden Regional Park has a truly unique landform with an interesting geological history. This valley was formed by tectonic uplift and years of erosion, smoothed out by recent human activities such as ranching.

It's a very nice walk from the top of Berkeley Hills. I recommend bringing shoes that can comfortably walk through muddy and rocky terrain.
