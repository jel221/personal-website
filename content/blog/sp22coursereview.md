Courses taken: Chem 4B, CS 61B, CS 70, Histart 11

## Chem 4B
Second course in the Chem 4 series. It's certainly a lot more interesting than 4A. The labs are very enjoyable, allowing you to gain experience with a variety of analytical tools and equipment. Also, Professors Bediako and Arnold are phenomenal. Some of the best professors I've ever had. It's a required course, but I recommend really understanding and appreciating the content being taught. I also recommend choosing your partners carefully for the final project. I docked half a point because of how unpleasant my experience was in the project.

**Weekly time commitment**: 13h (Lecture: 3h, Lab: 4h, Homework: 6h)

**Rating**: 9.5/10


## CS 61B
Data Structures course, with a hint of algorithms. Not to mention the variety of data structures that I learned about, simply interacting with the assignments actually helped me learn a variety of tools, such as Git, testing, and development environments. The course requires you to be a lot more independent, and I truly felt that I was becoming a more competent programmer. The homework and labs are a great supplement to lecture content. Projects are quite time-consuming, but they are very fun and instructive. I learned a lot from this course.

**Weekly time commitment**: 8h (Lecture: 3h, Homework: 5h)

**Rating**: 10/10


## CS 70
Discrete Math. The course content is somewhat interesting, but assignments and exams are a grueling experience. I think there's enough opinions on the Internet about this course, so I won't go further in-depth with this one.

**Weekly time commitment**: 8h (Lecture + Discussion: 5h, Homework: 3h)

**Rating**: 6/10

## Histart 11

Western art history. I was looking for a relatively laid-back breadth course, but I couldn't believe how difficult this course was. Nevertheless, what I learned from this course opened my eyes to a whole new world of art, providing me with insight to understand art on a more profound level. It took me a long time to write the essays, since the artworks being analyzed are not covered in lecture; it is up to the student to identify the style and interpret its meaning. There is a lot of content covered, so the exams are also pretty stressful. Still, the usefulness of the content overall outweighs the difficulty of the course.

**Weekly time commitment**: 6h (Lecture + Discussion: 4h, Homework: 2h)

**Rating**: 8/10
